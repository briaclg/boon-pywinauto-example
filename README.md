# Another pywinauto example
## Example Workflow
1. Open Calculator.
1. Press number and operator to do some calculation.
1. Get calculation result.
1. Open Notepad.
1. Put result from Calculator to Notepad.

This is so far from perfect but I hope every one can make this code better for any Python newbie.

Thank you.
